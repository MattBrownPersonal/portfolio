                    <p class="text-size-small">1.1 A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web
                    browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a
                    page from the server.</p>

                    <p class="text-size-small">1.2 Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser
                    and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on
                    the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.</p>

                    <p class="text-size-small">1.3 Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we
                    store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.</p>

                    <p class="text-size-small">1.4 Cookies can be used by web servers to identity and track users as they navigate different pages on a website and
